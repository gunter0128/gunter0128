##  About Me

I enjoy designing systems that combine **AI models** with **real-world data pipelines** — bridging the gap between model research and deployable software.  
Currently interning at **ITRI**, working on **LLM-based Verilog code generation accuracy improvement** and **cloud system integration**.  

I also serve as a **Python TA** at NTU, focusing on helping students build solid programming fundamentals.
